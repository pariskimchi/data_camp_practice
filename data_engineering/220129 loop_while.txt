# Basic For Loop structure 

# for loop in bash 
for x in 1 2 3
do 
    echo $x
done

# For loop number ranges 
{START...STOP...INCREMENT}

for x in {1..5..2}
do 
    echo $x
done

    =>  1 3 5 

# for loop syntax:

for ((x=2;x<=4;x+=2))
do
    echo $x
done

# Glob 

for book in books/*
do 
    echo $book
done

# Shell within a shell to for loop

for book in $(ls book/ | grep -i 'air')
do 
    echo $book
done

# WHILE statement example
x=1
while [ $x -le 3];
do 
    echo $x
    ((x+=1))
done



# Practice 


# create a FOR statement on files in directory 

for file in robs_files/*.py
do
    #create IF statement using grep
    if grep -q 'RandomForestClassifier' $file; then 

        # Move wanted files to to_keep/ folder 
        mv $file to_keep/
    fi
done
