Data workflow 

1. Data collection & Storage 
2. Data Preparation 
3. Exploration & Visualization 
4. Experimentation & Prediction

Data Engineers 

deliver;

1. the correct data 
2. in the right form 
3. to the right people 
4. as efficiently as possible


A data engineer's responsibilities 

1. ingest data from different sources 
2. opimize databases for analysis 
3. remove corrupted data 
4. develop, construct, test and maintain data architectures 


Data engineers and big data 

- Big data becomes the norm    
    => 

- Big data:
    => have to think about 
        "how to deal with it's size?"

    => tradional methods don't work


The five V's

1. Volume(how much?)
2. Variety(what kind?)
3. velocity(how frequent?)
4. veracity(how accurate?)
5. value(how useful?)


Data engineers vs data scientist 

1. data collection & storage 



data scientist 
    => data preparation + exploration + experimetaion & prediction
