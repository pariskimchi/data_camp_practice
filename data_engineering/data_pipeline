Step of Data engineering 

1. Ingest 
2. Process 
3. Store
4. Need Pipelines 
5. Automate flow from one station to the next
6. provide up-to-date, accurate, relevant data


Data pipelines flow 


Automate 
1.Extract 
2. transform 
3. combine 
4. validate 
5. load 

Reduce 
1. Human intervetion 
2. errors 
3. time it takes data to flow
